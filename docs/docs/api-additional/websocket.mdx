# Websocket
## Interacting with real-time data
To simplify process of establishing connection with server, subscribing to streams, 
authentication and keeping main advantage of reactive streams, backpressure, 
both client and server use RSocket protocol.

### Connecting to RSocket server
To connect with RSocket server, client has to configure **web socket client** (not tcp) to use url: `ws://localhost:8083/events`
and then provide jwt token in composite metadata.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    ```java
    MimeType authenticationMimeType =
      MimeTypeUtils.parseMimeType(WellKnownMimeType.MESSAGE_RSOCKET_AUTHENTICATION.getString());
    BearerTokenMetadata token = ...;
    Mono<RSocketRequester> requester = RSocketRequester.builder()
      .setupMetadata(token, authenticationMimeType)
    ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### RSocket interaction model
- request/response (stream of 1)
- request/stream (finite stream of many)
- fire-and-forget (no response)
- event subscription (infinite stream of many)?

Only request/stream is used in our case

### Subscribing to events
To lessen resource usage of websocket connection, concept of topics is used.
There is 1 endpoint for real-time communication:
- `/community/{communityId}/messages`

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
- `/community/{communityId}/general`?
- `/user/messages`
- `/user/...`

Each client can easily request and cancel many streams at once, 
this means that it shouldn't affect performance.

### Events format
Events are formatted in json, with two main fields:
- `name` - unique id of event
- `data` - payload of event (changes depending on name of event)

Example event message:
```json
{
  "name":"MESSAGE_CREATE_EVENT",
  "data": {
    "id":"123",
    "channel":"8507337136406528",
    "text":"Some text message",
    "user":"12817543232225280"
  }
}
```
As visible in example above, there are no null fields as sending empty fields is unnecessary in most cases.
Clients should implement optional fields in their receiving objects.
